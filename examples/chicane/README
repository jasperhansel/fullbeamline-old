Since this simulation takes a long time, before running it you should set the
timeout to a large value with the command 'fullbeamline --set timeout 1000'.
Then run 'fullbeamline'. Within tao, try the commands 'call twiss',
'call bunch_size', or 'call phase_space N' (N is the element name or index).
If nothing is displayed, try restarting tao until it works (plotting in tao can
be buggy sometimes).
